### Hi, I'm David ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm David Laskowski. I'm currently an undergraduate student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. I will be graduating in May 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I have had a passion for problem-solving and creating, which I plan to pursue as a career in Software Engineering or Cyber Security.
